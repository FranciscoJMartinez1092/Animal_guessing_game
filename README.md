# Animal_guessing_game

# In this game you input five animal names. Afterwards you are given an animal name you inputed which has had its characters rearranged. You have to guess the animal name. On the first turn, if you win the difficulaty goes up, if you guess wrong the difficulty remains the same. As you continue to guess right, the difficulty goes up with more animals mixed in the vector of arranged characters. Also once you keep succeeding some of the characters are replaced with underscores. If you guess wrong after succeeding once, the difficulty will go down.
